# Exercise 03

Why does the alert show `Jack` first and then `undefined`?

    function identity() {
        var name = 'Jack';
        alert(name);
        return
        name
    };
    
    var who = identity();
    alert(who)

# Answer
The reason the alert shows us a "undefined" the second time it is called, is because the return statement is affected by automatic semicolon insertion (ASI).

    ...
        alert(name);
        return
        name
    ...

is transformed by ASI into:

    alert(name);
    return;
    name;

Meaning that the following return statement breaks the function execution.
